- 👋 Hi, I’m @agoldson
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and blue teaming in particular, the ancient dark arts of Fortran, PalmOS and Maemo Programming, Aerospace and Tissue Engineering, HPC - High Performance Computing, Real Estate Investing, and E-commerce. Suffice it to say, if its technical or sciency, Im interested.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - 2022/08/17 Ravenously consuming the course content from HackTheBox. Transitioning from network engineering to cybersecurity has been exhilarating. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my above interests or interesting technical problems. Thus far Ive never met a problem I cant outright solve or meaningfully contribute towards. Lets jam together :)
